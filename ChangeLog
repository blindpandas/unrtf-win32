      - new build system by Claudio Fontana <claudio@gnu.org>
	fixed creation date spelling and added support for accented characters
	in titles from Laurent Monin
0.20.1
      - minor fix in convert.c for Solaris System
0.20.2
      - minor fix to unterminated comment output, added attr_get_param()
0.20.3

0.20.4
      - nopict mode bug fixes
0.20.5
      - added --noremap option, some html entity corrections, updated to GPL v3

0.21.3
      - 
      - added '--quiet' flag which suppresses leading comments in output
      - default directory for config files is now /usr/local/share/unrtf
	and this can be changed when configure is run at compilation time
      - subdirs in config directory eliminated making it easier for a user
	to supply their own in a single directory specified with -P
      - code for two hex characters introduced in 0.21.2 completely replaced
	by more generalised string handling.
      - major improvements to codepage handling
      - major improvements in unicode handling
      - latex config file improved.  Some Greek characters output properly.
      - troff_mm config file improved such that this option is now useful
0.21.2
      - added feof() calls to fgets() and fgetchar() instances so end-of
        file is correctly determined under AIX
      - supplemented code to handle special characters specified with
        two hex characters (e.g. \'81\'83) as output by some RTF
	writers.  This code is experimental, and uses the SHIFT_JIS
	codepage for conversion.
      - definitions in html.config changed to ensure values of markup variables
        are enclosed in double quotes, e.g. size="3" instead of size=3.  This
	is a first step towards supporting production of XHTML.
0.21.1
      - fixed strings in unicode_to_string() (unicode.c) to be null
	terminated instead of newline terminated.  This prevents spurious
	newline output after characters in Symbol font.  It also overcomes a
	fault whereby characters in the symbol font were being output as
	unicode instead of the desired entities defined in the output
	specification.
      - suppressed output of <font face="Symbol"> as this is wrong if
	characters are changed to unicode or entities
      - changed path set with -P to be directory containing the output
	charmaps specifications, and changed the default path to
	/usr/local/lib/unrtf for the same reason.  This makes it possible
	to set a different default path, useful for example if one cannot
	install files in /usr/local/lib.
      - dropped "outputs" and "charmaps" sub-directories in the configuration
        directory.  Output configuration files are now named "html.conf",
	"text.conf" etc. and the symbol font charmap file is "SYMBOL.charmap".
      - charmap specifications now sought in the search path
      - compensate for RTF with unicodes specified as negative numbers,
	possibly due to overflow on a 16bit machine?
      - changed processing of --html (etc.) args so that "-t html" and
	"--html" are equivalent, i.e. both subject to search path set with
	"-P"
0.21.3:
      - major changes to code page support and UTF handling
      - improved LaTeX output
      - /usr/local/lib no longer hard wired - set by configure
0.21.4:
      - ignore embedded picture which cannot be rendered
      - allow unnested bold/italic to be interpreted as expected.  Such input
      	may be outside the RTF spec, but can be created by TextEdit.  The
	change has been limited to the bold command (cmd_b in convert.c)
	on an experimental basis.  If no bugs appear it could be more generally
	applied.
0.21.5:
      - improved code for the unnested case and extended to more RTF commands
0.21.6:
      - improved man page
      - improved USAGE string
      - fix to attr.c for clang compilation
0.21.7:
      - improved code for creation of image files when RTF files containing
      	images processed

        \info content
0.21.8:
      - Changed bug reporting in unrtf.1
      - Test file for newly supported EMF image type.
      - Fixed all -Wall compilation warning
      - Bogus test in op_translate_buffer() caused error messages and data
		truncation
      - cmd_maybe_ignore(): test next command presence in the cmd hashes
		instead of listing locally the commands that should be processed
      - Fix unrtf looping when closing any underlining except the basic (ul)
		one
      - Open Picture files in wb mode instead of w for Windows portability.
		Fixes bug #21274
      - html output doctype value needs to be quoted
      - Skip binary data after \bin command
      - Simplified shared string storage in hash.c and word.c: suppressed
		the "index" value and replaced it by string address. Simpler
		and faster. Other changes are making shared string refs const
      - Better processing of \pict including addition of EMF type.
      - Fix access overflow occurring while translating unicode data from
		garbled or truncated file
      - Fix buffer access overflow caused by truncated file
      - Need to check word_string() output not NULL in cmd_maybe_ignore()
      - String equality test while searching the command table for command
		having parameter would access byte out of allocated memory
		and produce potentially random result. Fixes AddressSanitizer
		error found by Hanno Boeck
      - String equality test while searching the command table for command
		having parameter would access byte out of allocated memory
		and produce potentially random result. Fixes AddressSanitizer
		error found by Hanno Boeck
      - Substitute appropriate prefix-depending paths in the man page prior
		to installing
      - Limit depth of group embedding to guard against malicious files with
		thousands of consecutive {
      - check index before access into month_strings array
      - attr_get_param(): silence warning message in frequent and normal
		case (Fabian Keil)
      - attrstack_drop(): Properly drop the last stack element (Fabian Keil)
		+ get rid of unused variable in attrstack_push()
      - hash_get_string(): Reject invalid indexes (author: Fabian Keil)
0.21.9:
      - Support EndNote reference citations in convert.c
      - Improved handling of some tables
      - Fixed --text processing broken in 0.21.8 - outputs/text.conf
