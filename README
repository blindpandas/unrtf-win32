Greetings,

UnRTF is a moderately complicated converter from RTF to other
formats. It works reasonably well but it has bugs and the output is 
a somewhat ugly. Bugs are known to include paragraph alignment
and picture storing.

Compiling with GCC: type "make all", and assuming you have GCC
and GNU make, it should compile without any warnings or errors 
under Linux, BSD, and DOS (using DJGPP). 

This program includes no warranty whatsoever. It is provided
"AS IS". For more information please read the COPYING
document, which should be included with the source code.
It describes the GNU Public License, which covers UnRTF.

Enjoy,
