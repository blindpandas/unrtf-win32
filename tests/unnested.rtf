\f0\fs24 \cf0 Test of b0 unbolding\
\pard\pardeftab720

\f1\fs26 \cf2 Normal text in a paragraph.  I copied this structure from a RTF document created by Mac OSX, but changed the text.  Most of the head matter and other flags are probably irrelevant, but included here for completeness.  There is \'a0this funny flag too.  
\b \ul Here's some bold and underlined stuff.
\b0 \ulnone   Now bold and underline should both be off, although they are taken off in the same order they were put on instead of in nested fashion.\
